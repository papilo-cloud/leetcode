# Leetcode Coding Patterns

1. [Two Pointers](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Two_Pointers)
    - The Two Pointers pattern involves using two pointers to iterate through an array or list, often used to find pairs or elements that meet specific criteria.

2. [Prefix Sum](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Prefix_Sum)
    - Prefix Sum involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index i represents the sum of the array from the start up to i. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.

3. [Sliding Window](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Sliding_Window)
    - The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

2. [Slow Fast Pointers](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/slow_fast_pointers)
    - The Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare) pattern is used to detect cycles in linked lists and other similar structures.

2. [Top K Element](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/too_k_elements)
    - The Top 'K' Elements pattern finds the top k largest or smallest elements in an array or stream of data using heaps or sorting.

2. [Overlapping Intervals](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/overlapping_intervals)
    - The Overlapping Intervals pattern is used to merge or handle overlapping intervals in an array.

2. [Bit Manipulation](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Bit)

2. [Modified Binary Search](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/MOdified_binary_search)
    - The Modified Binary Search pattern adapts binary search to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding elements in rotated sorted arrays.
    - Use this pattern for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays where you need to find a specific element.

2. [Monotonic Stack](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Stacks/monotonic_stack)
    - The Monotonic Stack pattern uses a stack to maintain a sequence of elements in a specific order (increasing or decreasing).
    - Use this pattern for problems that require finding the next greater or smaller element.

2. [Monotonic Queue](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Queue/monotonic_queue)
    - The Monotonic Queue pattern uses a queue to maintain a sequence of elements in a specific order (increasing or decreasing).

1. [LinkedList In-place Reversal](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Linkedlist/in_place_reversal)
    - The In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts of a linked list without using extra space.

1. [Two Heaps](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/leetcode/tree/main/Heap/two_heaps)
    - This approach is quite useful when dealing with the problems where we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts.
